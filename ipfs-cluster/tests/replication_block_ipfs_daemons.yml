name: Replication block ipfs daemons
config:
  nodes: 5
  selector: app=ipfs-cluster
  times: 2
  expected:
      successes: 2 # 1 for each iteration (to start)
      failures: 0
      timeouts: 0
steps:
  - name: add random stuff to ipfs

  - name: add random stuff to cluster with replication

  - name: block ipfs daemons

  - name: check that random stuff is repinned with correct replication factor

# Current plan:
#   Just put random stuff everywhere
#   and pin it everywhere.  Take down 2/5 nodes
#   wait a little bit, make sure that all hashes
#   are pinned on the 3 remaining.  More precisely
#   make sure that there are always 3 "Yes this is pinned" messages
#   I think it is ok to not keep track of which nodes are which,
#   as we expect to fail on a certain number and succeed on another number
